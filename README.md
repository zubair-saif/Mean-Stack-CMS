# Mean Stack CMS

MEAN Stack Blog CMS Build with Mongoose/MongoDB, Express, Angular 4 and Node.js, still in production...

Basic Functionalities
This is a MEAN stack blog for fast and quick blogging on the go, full CRUD capabilities and user authentication, allows multiple users.

User Authentication
User Post Dashboard
Categorisable Posts
Full CMS post creation functionality
Text/Code/Image input fields for posts
Fully custom lightweight styles
Build notes:

Backend built in Node.js
Express/Bodyparser for handling routing/post and user API
Mongoose for MongoDB integration
passport for JWT authentication
Angular 4 for front end
SCSS integrated with Angular for encapsulated global/non-global styles
ngx-highlightjs used for code syntax highlighting
angular-font-awesome used for font graphics
ngx-infinite-scroll added but not currently implemented for dynamic post content loading
To-Do:

Full responsiveness/Cross Browser stylings need finishing
Written articles need to be uploaded using CMS (not a real concern here)
Improve UI for initial load
Add animations to post/page navigation
